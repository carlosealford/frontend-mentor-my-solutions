## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS with Flexbox
- Version control Git

### What I learned

Something interesting happened while I was working on this project. When I compared the screenshot of the component against the page displayed by the browser the colours were not the same. The screenshot rendered a different colour.

The use of Hue, Saturation and Lightness (hsl) colour values was new and interesting way of looking at colours. I still need to dive a bit deeper.

Here is a little sample of the dask blue, in hsl values, used on the component:

```css3
body {
  --dark-blue: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
  ...
}
```

### Continued development

Naming of CSS classes is currently not my strength. Something there is a struggle getting the right names to suit the elements purpose.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Their flexbox reference is fantastic. Has all the information needed.
