## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript you'll need for this challenge is to initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process :computer:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS grid and flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Git and Github
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned to use @mixins which are fun and time savers. Used it for the share button component which is used by two 
elements and uses the same styles except for the background colour which I passed in as an argument. SO handy.

### Continued development

Feeling stronger about my SASS but a little bit more practice is required. Mixins and Partials are there but need 
to understand better in which situations they are best suited.
