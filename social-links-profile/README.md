## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I want to be able to look at an idea and be able to estimate the time it would take to complete, therefore the project was a way for me to practice my time management skills rather than learning a new techonology.

The importance of planning is taken for granted a lot of the time. It may seem daunting but it will save a lot of time when it is time to develop the app!

It took me a total of **2.2 hours** to setup, create both mobile and large screen versions and write the README with a screenshot. I stimated _1 hour and 20 minutes_. That is a total of 40 minutes more than expected.

### Continued development

I will continue to do this challenges to improve my time management and predictions.
