## Overview ðŸ‘‹

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

### Links

- Solution URL: [Github Repo](https://github.com/web-shuriken/3-column-preview-card)
- Live URL: [3 Columns Preview Site](https://web-shuriken.github.io/3-column-preview-card/)

## Setup

The project has a live URL, as above, if you just want to have a look at it.

To use locally, just clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in your browser or run a local server within the project folder. SASS has already been pre-compiled so the project will just work.

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile first approach
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
- Git - version control

### What I learned

I learned how to use SASS **Extend/Inheritance**. Used it to create the active states for the link which is used in each card. Made it easier to maintain.

```sass
%active-states
  background: hsla(var(--neutral-bg-color), 0)
  border: .15rem solid var(--neutral-bg-color)
  color: var(--neutral-bg-color)
  padding: .85rem 1.95rem
```

### Continued development

HTML and CSS are getting stronger but I still feel that my SASS needs some more work. Will keep focusing on this in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [SASS parent selector](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/parent-selector) - This helped understand how to use pseudo-classes in SASS.
