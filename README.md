## Overview

### My vision :eyes:

To join the world of web development professionally and share my passion of
all things web. This way I can help create amazing things which can be enjoyed
by other people, whether to help them achieve a goal or just have fun.

### Repo purpose :smiley:

The purpose of this repo is to use these challenges as practice and improve or
gain knowledge about web development. Maybe in the mean time also help other
developers tackling the same challenges and are stuck.

## Images in the readme

Alright, after many attempts the only solution which worked for me was
the use of the `<img src="" width="" height="">` tag.

If you use the tag on separate lines without a space between them. The images
are rendered inline.

```html
<img src="" width="" height="">
<img src="" width="" height="">
```
