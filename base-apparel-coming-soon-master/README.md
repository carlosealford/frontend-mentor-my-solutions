## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process :computer:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS grid and flexbox
- Mobile-first aproach (always)
- Git and Github
- JavaScript (to check for valid email address)

### What I learned

This challenge was not hard but I did learn more about accessibility!. I learned how to make assitive technologies aways of toast or pop up messages using the `role="alert"` and other aria attributes. At first aria felt a bit forced but now it feels like the app is not complete without it. There is so much to learn, but just like semantic HTML it will come with time, practice and awareness.

### Continued development

Accessibility! Ay11 is there to help where there is no semantic HTML to do the job.
